## EasyCrypt

EasyCrypt is an interactive framework for verifying the security of
cryptographic constructions in the computational model. EasyCrypt
adopts the codebased approach, in which security goals and hardness
assumptions are modelled as probabilistic programs (called experiments
or games) with unspecified adversarial code, and uses tools issued
from program verification and programming language theory to rigorously
justify cryptographic reasoning.

EasyCrypt is part of the [Formosa project](https://formosa-crypto.org/).
